The aim of this project is to create the system for MRI data pre-processing and post-processing using Python, scipy, cython and Qt5. The project is divided into 11 modules:
  
  
1. MRI reconstruction<br />
2. Intensity inhomogeneity correction<br />
3. Non-stationary noise estimation<br />
4. Non-stationary noise filtering #1<br />
5. Non-stationary noise filtering #2<br />
6. Diffusion tensor imaging<br />
<7th module excluded> <br />
8. Skull stripping<br />
9. Segmentation<br />
10. Upsampling<br />
11. Brain 3D<br />
12. Oblique imaging
