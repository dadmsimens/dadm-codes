\section{Module 4. Non-stationary noise filtering 1}

The unit tests was implemented to check how the programme behaves in different conditions. The few tests

\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Test\_empty\_input\_data} - test checks how the code behave in case receiving empty dataset,
	\item \textbf{Test\_incorrect\_input\_data} - test checks how the code behave, when incorrect data is passed to the function,
	\item \textbf{Test\_size\_input\_data} - test checks if the size of data is changed on the output of code,
	\item \textbf{Test\_none\_noise\_map} - if code received empty data of noise maps, the function should rise an error,
	\item \textbf{Test\_LMMSE\_function\_changes} - test checks if the input data was changed in the LMMSE-filter function.

\end{itemize}

The results of tests were as it was expected and code behaves in correct way.
