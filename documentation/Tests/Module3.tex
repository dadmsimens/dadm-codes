\section{Module 3. Non-stationary noise estimation}
In order to test effectiveness of implemented algorithm the results of it were compared to results of algorithm prepared to perforem calculatioans contained in \cite{aja2015spatially}. The algorithm for the article was implemented in Matlab.

Results from Python algorithm are not perfect equivalent of the results from Matlab algorithm however ther are very similar and seem to be suitable for 
further processing of the image.
