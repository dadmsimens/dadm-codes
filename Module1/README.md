Implementation (MATLAB) of 1st Module: pMRI data reconstruction.
  Details about algorithms are included in each (mostly) function.
  
  Main function: SENSE_code_BrainWebDATA.m
  
  PLEASE: do not use these codes for your private purposes and further distributions.
  
  Generally you don't need to check the code, if you want to proceed with your modules, just use data loaded:
  \Datasets\Synthetic_BrainWeb\DATA
  
  This implementation is not a complete form, needs a few further improvements.
  TBC.
